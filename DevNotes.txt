Development Structure
---------------------

The source folder structure is required by the solution & projects to be like
this:-

+-<application>
| +-<tests>
+-Lib
| +-Core
| +-MDBL
|   +-Test
+-Scripts

The following commands will create that structure by cloning the various
application and library repositories:-

C:\> mkdir Win32\Lib
C:\> git clone https://github.com/chrisoldwood/Core.git Win32\Lib\Core
C:\> git clone https://github.com/chrisoldwood/MDBL.git Win32\Lib\MDBL
<optional>
C:\> git clone https://github.com/chrisoldwood/Scripts.git Win32\Scripts

Command Line Builds
-------------------

Included in the scripts folder is one for building via the command line:-

C:\> Win32\Scripts\SetVars vc90
C:\> Win32\Scripts\Build debug Win32\Lib\MDBL\Test\Test.sln

There is also one for upgrading to a later version of Visual C++:-

C:\> Win32\Scripts\SetVars vc140
C:\> Win32\Scripts\Upgrade Win32\Lib\MDBL\Test\Test.sln

Test Suite
----------

The ODBC part of the test suite relies on the Microsoft Text Driver, which is
usually installed by default, and a local SQL Server instance, such as the free
version -- SQL Express. You can install that via Chocolatey:

C:\> choco install -y sql-server-express

You can test the SQL Server installation with:

C:\> sqlcmd -E -S .\SQLEXPRESS -Q "select getdate();"
